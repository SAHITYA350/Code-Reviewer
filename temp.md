❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(a,b) {return (a+b)} console.log(sum(2,3));
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ Lack of readability due to combining multiple statements on one line.
* ❌ Missing semicolon after the function definition, though JavaScript's automatic semicolon insertion (ASI) might
handle it, it's best to include it for clarity.
* ❌ Inconsistent spacing around operators and curly braces reduces readability.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}

console.log(sum(2, 3));
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ Separated the function definition and the `console.log` statement onto different lines for better readability.
* ✔ Added a semicolon after the function definition for explicit statement termination.
* ✔ Improved spacing around operators and curly braces to enhance readability.
